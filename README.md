# Phosphene App

A visual simulation of phosphenes - the colorful patterns and light effects that appear when your eyes are closed. This application uses Three.js to create an immersive 3D visualization of these fascinating neural phenomena.

## What are Phosphenes?

Phosphenes are the visual phenomena characterized by seeing light without light actually entering the eye. They can appear as floating geometric patterns, swirling colors, or flashing lights when you close your eyes, apply gentle pressure to your eyelids, or experience certain neurological conditions.

This application aims to recreate these visual experiences in a digital format, allowing users to explore and customize the phosphene effect.

## Features

- 3D visualization of phosphene patterns
- Customizable colors, sizes, and effects
- Interactive controls for adjusting the visualization
- Fullscreen mode for immersive experience
- Design mode for customizing the appearance
